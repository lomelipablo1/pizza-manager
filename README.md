# pizza-manager
Applicant exercise for StrongMind

## Overview
This web app was made for an excercise requested by StrongMind called "Pizza Manager". Pizza Manager is created using Ruby on Rails and a virtual linux dev environment. I chose Ruby on Rails since I've seen a lot of buzz around the framework and would like to learn something new since I've had no prior experience with it. This project was challenging but not impossible since I am familar with web development and databases. It was also fun learning how to deploy this app using railway.app since I've never done that before. After all the learning and iterations of getting my web app to work per the requirments requested, I am happy to present this live working web app. Please visit https://pizza-manager-production.up.railway.app/ to try it out.
 
## Setup
To setup locally, you need to have Rails, Ruby and Postgres installed.

After that you can start my webapp after cloning this repo by using this command in your terminal:
rails server

## Testing
To run tests simply use this command in your terminal:
rails test

Sidenote: Currently there is 1 failture and 1 error for the pizzatopping_controller tests. Need to work on making these tests work which I believe is due to the way I've setup my pizzatoppings controller.
